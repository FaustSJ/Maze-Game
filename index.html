A maze of the human anatomy!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a parasite inside of a human body.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a parasite that craves the innerds of reptiles. Unfortunately, the one
that consummed you is not a reptile. You have no interest in harming this human, 
though the human's defense system doesn't agree. Starting from the asophogus,
you must safely navigate to the pelvis to be free of your human victum.
</li>

People who like puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Perhaps two or three minutes.

The standard maze strategies apply here. If you hit a dead end, go back to your
last cross-path and take another path.
